<h1>MapReduce Instance API</h1>
<p>
This is a proof of concept for building a new instance-based MapReduce API
(<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1183">MAPREDUCE-1183</a>)
layered on top of the existing Hadoop MapReduce APIs.
It is intended to promote further discussion of what an instance-based API should
look like.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note: the API is not stable, nor
has the implementation been performance tested.</b>
<p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Works with Apache Hadoop 0.20.x APIs</li>
<li>Implementations for the "old" and "new" (context objects) APIs in
{@link org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.instanceapi.MapRedJob} and
{@link org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.instanceapi.MapReduceJob}.</li>
<li>Stateful Mappers, Reducers, etc should implement the <code>java.io.Serializable</code>
interface. Those that don't implement this interface are treated as they are in the existing APIs,
i.e. passed by class name. (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1183?focusedCommentId=12773786&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12773786">Suggested by Hong Tang</a>.)</li>
<li>Provides better type checking (but not inference, due to erasure) of key and value types than the existing API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Open issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should we expose all of the old and new APIs through the new object, or should uses just use the <code>JobConf</code> or <code>Job</code> to access APIs that are the same?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<p>
Stateful components are serialized using the Java Serialization API, and stored in
the Hadoop configuration by Base64-encoding the serialized bytes. This is transparent to the
user.
